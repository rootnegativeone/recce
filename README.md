# Recce

**Status:** Proof of Concept (Active Iteration and Validation)  
**Disclaimer:** This project is under active development. Many features are incomplete or non-functional. Proceed with caution and expect changes.

## Overview

Recce is an experimental platform for exploring and analyzing cyber-physical systems through interactive diagrams, maps, and conceptual tools. It aims to bridge the gap between physical and digital realms, offering a new way to visualize and interact with systems engineering and analysis.

## Current Features

- **Sitemap Proof of Concept:** Visualize the navigation structure of Recce.
- **Scrolling Screencapture:** Explore and record system structures visually.
- **API Call Analysis:** Evaluate and understand backend interactions.
- **Basic Systems Analysis:** Early-stage tools for analyzing system interrelationships.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- **Incomplete Features:**
  - Subscriptions and accounts are not yet functional.
  - The systems analysis panel is a work in progress.
  - Systems input fields are currently non-functional.

- **No Guarantees:** This proof-of-concept build may be unstable and is not production-ready.

## Next Steps

We are actively iterating on Recce based on user feedback to refine its features and improve usability. Your insights are invaluableâ€”please share your thoughts if you explore this proof of concept!
